Description: Corset plots are a new visualization technique, which are used strictly to visualize 
 repeat measures at 2 time points (such as pre- and post- data). The distribution of measurements 
 at each time point are visualized using half violins, whilst the trajectories of individual change
 are visualized via spaghetti plots by connecting these two points linearly. These lines can be 
 coloured to represent percent change or other user-defined value. This method of visualization is 
 ideal for showing the heterogeneity of data, including differences by sub-groups.
    The package relies on 'ggplot2' allowing for easy integration so that users can customize 
 their visualizations as required. Users can create corset plots using data in either wide or 
 long format using the functions gg_corset() or gg_corset_elongated(), respectively.
